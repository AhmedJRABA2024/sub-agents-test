# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This repository appears to be in initial setup phase with minimal content. When the project is developed further, this file should be updated with:

## Common Commands (To be added when project is set up)

- Build command: `[to be determined]`
- Test command: `[to be determined]`
- Lint command: `[to be determined]`
- Development server: `[to be determined]`

## Architecture Overview (To be added when code is present)

Currently no source code is present in the repository. The architecture section should be populated once the project structure is established.

## Notes

- A `coverage/` directory exists, suggesting test coverage reporting may be planned
- This file should be updated as the project develops to include specific build tools, frameworks, and architectural decisions
