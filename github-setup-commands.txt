# GitHub Repository Setup Commands
# Run these commands after creating the repository on GitHub

# Steps to complete:
# 1. Go to github.com and create a new public repository named "sub-agents-test"
# 2. Do NOT initialize with README (you already have content)
# 3. After creation, GitHub will show your repository URL
# 4. Replace YOUR_USERNAME below with your actual GitHub username
# 5. Run the commands below

# 1. Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sub-agents-test.git

# 2. Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# 3. Push to GitHub (first time)
git push -u origin master

# 4. Verify push was successful
git status

# After running these commands successfully:
# - Your repository will be live on GitHub
# - Your local repository will be connected to the remote
# - Both commits (aefe102 and af8f7e5) will be pushed to GitHub
